# Predictive-Model-on-Housing-Price

Is it possible to build a predictive model for price of a your dream house? It sounds fascinating, isnt it? 

That has prompted me to initiate this project, which was 
also a part of college assessment. I had fun playing around with multiple features as the chosen dataset has got 32 variables.

The aim of this project is to build a predictive model and test how effective it is by a validation framework.

I summarized all steps in MS Word, MS Powerpoint and a Youtube video (this is kind of interesting experience too as I never create video nor upload anything on Youtube!). Here is the link if you would like to check it out (and give me a view!)

Overall, I enjoyed this project. 

Thank you!
